No contextkeeper.debug Log debug information in the MODX error log. No contextkeeper.disable_duplicate_button Disable the duplicate button in resources of not writable contexts. No contextkeeper.writable_contexts Comma separated list of writable context keys. - <p>As always, these system settings can be overridden by user group and user settings. Therefore, user group and user specific restrictions are possible.</p>"}]}
